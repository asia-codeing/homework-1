Code Refactor 
* In this project I am doing code refactoring for the website by using HTML Semantic Elements
* The Semantic Elements make the websites more accessible

* What is Web accessibility?
 Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

# Things apply on the website code:

* HTML Semantic Elements :
<article>	Defines independent, self-contained content
<aside>	    Defines content aside from the page content
<figcaption>Defines a caption for a <figure> element
<figure>	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams,
            photos,code listings, etc.
<footer>	Defines a footer for a document or section
<header>	Specifies a header for a document or section
<main>  	Specifies the main content of a document
<nav>	    Defines navigation links
