# Code Refactor 
* In this project I am doing code refactoring for the website by using HTML Semantic Elements.
* The Semantic Elements make the websites more accessible.

# Things apply on the code:
* HTML Semantic Elements :
'<article>'	Defines independent, self-contained content.
'<aside>'	    Defines content aside from the page content.
'<figure>'	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams,
            photos,code listings, etc.
'<footer>'	Defines a footer for a document or section.
'<header>'	Specifies a header for a document or section.
'<main>'  	Specifies the main content of a document.
'<nav>'	    Defines navigation links.
'<section>'	Defines a section in a document.

* Clean And Optimized CSS
